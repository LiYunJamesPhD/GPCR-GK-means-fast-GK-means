# GPCR_GK-means_fast_GK-means

# Abstract
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) are vulnerable to images that have been altered with well-engineered and imperceptible perturbations. We propose three color quan- tization pre-processing techniques to make DCNNs more robust to adversarial perturbation including Gaussian smoothing and PNM color reduction (GPCR), color quantization using Gaussian smoothing and K-means (GK-means), and fast GK-means. We evaluate the approaches on a subset of the ImageNet dataset. Our evaluation reveals that our GK-means-based algorithms have the best top-1 accuracy. We also present the trade-off between GK-means-based algorithms and GPCR with respect to computational time.
